LiveMarketAI is developed and tested on macOS , where the Pathway pipeline runs natively. On Windows, Pathway is not directly supported, so to run the full system, users need to use Docker. Docker provides a consistent environment, allowing Windows users to run the backend, frontend, and Pathway pipeline without compatibility issues, ensuring the demo works exactly as it does on Mac/Linux.
